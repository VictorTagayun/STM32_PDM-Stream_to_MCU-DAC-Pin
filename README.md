# STM32_PDM-to-DAC

## Purpose of Project

Learn how to:
1. Interface to a PDM microphone
2. Process PDM data to PCM

This project is preceded by interfacing the PDM microphone to an SPI interface of an MCU as discussed here https://github.com/VictorTagayun/STM32_SPI-TX-RX-DMA_SingleBoard

This project will:

1. Use a predefined stream of PDM data and convert/pack to byte size for input to the PDM filter
2. Feed the byte converted PDM data to PDM Filter and check the PCM-converted data and plot to excel/speadsheet

## Steps / Procedure

Get PDM bitstream data from 

1. Single cycle Full scale sinewave https://github.com/siorpaes/pdm_playground/blob/9aa442d8a7e3265fbcdbfb66111b8dbad301e928/pdmgenerator/Host/tones/pdm1MHz/tone500Hz.h
2. Single cycle Lower amplitude sinewave https://github.com/siorpaes/pdm_playground/blob/9aa442d8a7e3265fbcdbfb66111b8dbad301e928/pdmgenerator/Host/tones/pdm1MHz/tone500HzA4.h

Since these data are 2000 bits only, it is not divisible by a factor of 64 which will be chosen as the decimator qty/factor. To remedy this, we need to multiply the PDM data by 4. So we get 8000bit which will yield exatly 125 PCM data.
